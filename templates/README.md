# Pineapple Templates

These templates can be used with the [Pineapple Library](https://github.com/ncr4/pineapple-library) to quickly build websites.

## Usage

- Simply clone this repo and use the templates you'd like for your project. Customize as necessary.
- Each template runs on `Pineapple` and `Bootstrap 4`.

## Templates

### Waterfall

- Simple website, single page.
- "Waterfall" effect created by the page sliding into the users view via Javascript animations.

### Coming Soon

This is a simple coming soon template that can be customized for your use. I use this as a placeholder while sites are being built.
