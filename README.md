<h3 align="center">Pineapple - CSS & JS Library</h3>

<p align="center">Pineapple is a web development library including frequently used CSS and Javascript functions. Built over Bootstrap, Pineapple allows websites to be easily and quickly built.</p>

## Background
Pineapple was started as a way to fill in the gaps that Bootstrap did not fill. Since Bootstrap 4 and other frameworks have been updated, many of the original issues Pineapple fixed have found their way into these other frameworks and therefore, the Pineapple equivelent has been removed. What remains are functions or classes I often continue to use in my projects today in some form or another.

## Scope
This project's CSS is intended to be compiled with SASS.
```
- /css
  - /partials
    - /_animations.scss
    - /_banner.scss
    - /_buttons.scss
    - /_fonts.scss
    - /_grid.scss
    - /_hacks.scss
    - /_other.scss
  - /pineapple.scss
  - /pineapple-style.scss
  - /pineapple-utilities.scss
- /js
  - /pineapple.js
```

# Installation
Pineapple includes both SASS/CSS and JS files. Clone this repo and place the files in your projects directory and reference them similar to the example below. SASS files must be compiled into CSS if they aren't already.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="pineapple/css/pineapple.css">
<script src="pineapple/js/pineapple.css"></script>
```
