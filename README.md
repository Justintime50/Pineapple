# PINEAPPLE
### CSS & JS Library

Pineapple is a web development library including frequently used CSS and Javascript functions. Built over Bootstrap, Pineapple allows websites to be easily and quickly deployed.
 
There were some limitations at the time of this libraries creation in regards to Bootstrap that I wanted to build on its success and add a few tweaks and additions not found there.

### Documentation
There is documentation found in the `docs.html` page.

### Themes
Included in Pineapple are compatible themes to quickly build simple websites.
