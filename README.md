<p>Pineapple is a web development library including frequently used CSS and Javascript functions. Built over Bootstrap, Pineapple allows websites to be easily and quickly built.</p>

## Background

Pineapple was created as a way to fill in the gaps that Bootstrap did not fill years ago. Since Bootstrap 4 and other frameworks have been updated, many of the original issues Pineapple fixed have found their way into these other frameworks and therefore, the Pineapple equivelent has been removed. What remains are functions or classes that get reused in projects today in some form or another.

## Install

Pineapple includes both SCSS and Javascript files. The SCSS will need to be compiled into CSS as raw CSS is not included in this repo. Choose between implementing the `styles`, `utilities`, or the entire `Pineapple library`, all three options are included in the roo of the `css` folder.

Once the CSS has been compiled, include the CSS and Javascript into your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/pineapple.css">
<script src="path/to/pineapple.js"></script>
```
